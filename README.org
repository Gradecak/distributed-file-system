* Documentation
  see: https://gradecak.github.io/distributed-file-system/
  
* Running the Project
  From the root of the project run
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  chmod +x ./build.sh
  ./build.sh
  docoker-compose up
  #+END_SRC
  
  This will start the core DFS services, Authentication Service, Transaction Service and Directory Service.
  
  to add FileServers to the system you must individually spin up every fileserver instance by navigating to the project
  directory and executing the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stack build
  stack exec fileSystem-exe
  #+END_SRC
